Create (or configure) your own activities:
=========================================

Activities are so dissimiliar, they each need their own
design tables for definition and configuration:

  * Crush Match: different types of crushes.
  * Mail
  * Personals: various types of permissions and alerts.

Currently, even the permissions need their own tables.

However, the UI will present the activities (especially
    their permissions) in a unified way (or as much as
      possible).
